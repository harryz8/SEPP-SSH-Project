* compares it to what is in the fridge
* calculates the cost of the items in the recipe that aren't in the fridge
* we will use a web-scraper to get prices of items from a range of websites and then average them
* Recipe database is kept locally, and the user can add more to it.
* You could filter recipes based on recipe category.
## Meetings
We have decided to meet twice a week until the deadline, on tuesdays and thursdays 1-3pm.
## Branches
We decided to create our own branches to work in. They can only be merged into main after at least 1 other person has reviewed the pull request.
## [Kanban](https://github.com/users/harryz8/projects/1/views/1)
This is where issues (jobs) live. You can take any unassigned issue from the "Ready" queue, assign yourself, move it to the "In progress" queue and then work on it. Close the issue when you are done, and pull request on the branch you worked on it in.

We spent time splitting the EDR into issues and adding them to the kanban but it has not all been done so add more issues to the kanban as you think of them, and someone will pick them up.
