## What have we done since last time?

### Harry

I attempted to work out how to distribute the software using docker but docker does not work well with JavaFX so I have decided this would be impractical. I have finished linking the database to the Java code and I have written some more unit tests.

## What we want to achieve this time

Integrate and test our functions to produce a working prototype.

## What we achieved during this meeting

### Harry

I have fixed a github workflow issue by removing the requirement to run docker compose up as it is now done by gradle.
