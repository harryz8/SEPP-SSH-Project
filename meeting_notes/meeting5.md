## What have we done since last time?

### Harry

I attempted to work out how to distribute the software using docker but docker does not work well with JavaFX so I have decided this would be impractical. I have finished linking the database to the Java code and I have written some more unit tests.


### Khaled
I have deleted couple of cost entities that we no longer would use in that way from Ingredients class and the Recipe_Ingredients class then pushed it. I also set commands for the users in the main class whether the user wants to add a recipe or get a recipe, that will be linked to Tom's code that he wrote to merge the work and that should make the user to be able to use the commands 


## What we want to achieve this time

Integrate and test our functions to produce a working prototype.

## What we achieved during this meeting

### Harry

I have fixed a github workflow issue by removing the requirement to run docker compose up as it is now done by gradle.
