# Software Development

## Requirements and Design

See the original [EDR](./SSH_EDR.pdf). Any subsequent changes made will be outlined in the repo documentation or [here](./EDRChanges.md).

## Implementation and Unit Testing

### Implementation

We will use the Kanban found [here](https://github.com/users/harryz8/projects/1/views/1).

### Unit Testing

[Here](./softwareDevelopmentTechniques.md#Unit-Tests).

## Integration Testing

[Here](./softwareDevelopmentTechniques.md#Integration-Tests).

## Deployment

We will set the latest version of the code as a release in the gitHub repo, and keep big version changes tagged with a version number. This is a prototype so wont be properly deployed; this just makes sure that if someone wanted to download the latest proper version from the GitHub website, they can easily find it.
