# Software Development Techniques
## Version Control

We are going to use git with gitHub.
The main branch is set up to require a review before a branch is merged, i.e. one other person from the team (other than the pull requester) must review a pull request before it is merged with main.

## Team Workflows

## Testing

### Manual Tests

### Unit Tests

We will carry out unit tests on the Java code using the JUnit module.
We will also carry out tests on the SQL database.

We plan to:
1. Write stubs for functions
2. Write tests for these functions
3. Then implement these functions, making them pass the tests

### Integration Tests

### Property Based Tests

### Formal Verification

### A/B Tests

We will run intensive testing through a beta release to a select percentage of users until enough
feedback is collected. If required, tweaks to the program will be made.

### Integration Tests

### Other Types of tests go here

## Build Tools

We are going to use Gradle as our build tool.

## Dependencies

- JavaFX
- JUnit

## Continuous Integration

We will use a gitHub workflow to automate continuous integration.

## Containerisation

Do we need to use containerisation?
